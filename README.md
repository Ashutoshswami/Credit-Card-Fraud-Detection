## Abstract :
It  is  vital  that  credit  card  companies  are  able  to identify  fraudulent credit  card  transactions  so that  customers are  not  charged  for  items  that  they  did  not  purchase.  Such problems can be tackled with Data Science and its importance, along  with  Machine  Learning, 
## Introduction :
'Fraud'  in  credit  card  transactions  is  unauthorized  and unwanted  usage  of  an  account  by  someone  other  than  the owner of that account. Necessary prevention measures can be taken to stop this abuse and the behaviour of such fraudulent practices  can  be  studied  to  minimize it  and  protect against similar occurrences in the future.In other words, Credit Card Fraud can be defined as a case where a person uses someone elseâ€™s credit card for personal reasons while the owner and the card issuing authorities are unaware of the fact that the card is being used.
Fraud  detection  involves  monitoring  the  activities  of populations of  users in  order to  estimate, perceive  or avoid objectionable behaviour, which consist of fraud, intrusion, and defaulting. 
## Libraries and Tools used :
   Python, Jupyter Notebook,Machine LearningAlgorithm - Logistic Regression, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy etc.

## Conclusion :
Credit  card  fraud  is  without  a  doubt  an  act  of  criminal dishonesty.  This  project shows methods  of  fraud  along  with  their  detection and how machine learning can  be applied to get better results in fraud detection along with the algorithm, explanation its implementation and experimentation results.
